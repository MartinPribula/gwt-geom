gwt-geom
-------

gwt-geom is a port of the OpenJDK java.awt.geom package to work on GWT. 
It is especially useful for Constructive Area Geometry (CAG) manipulations.
I use it for easily testing whether a screen click on an image is contained
in a certain shape { for example shape.contains(x,y) }.

Drawing to screen can be done using a 2d drawing library (currently gwt-g2d
is supported).

Most of the java.awt.geom package is available, as well as a few shapes from
the java.awt package. I have chosen to rename the package to gwt.awt since
we aren't providing all of java.awt and this helped me to ensure I wasn't using
any unported code.

Run ant devmode to see a simple demo.

See ant -p for more options
